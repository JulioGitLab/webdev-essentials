        Originally created at <em>Bell Labs</em> by
        <span class="developer">Dennis Ritchie</span>, <strong>C</strong> (/<em>si:</em>/, as in
        the letter <em>c</em>) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language
        supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static
        type system prevents unintended operations. By design, <strong>C</strong> provides
        constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use
        in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include
        operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers to
        embedded systems.<br />A successor to the programming language <em>B</em>,
        <strong>C</strong> was originally developed to construct utilities running on
        <em>Unix</em>. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.
        During the 1980s, <strong>C</strong> gradually gained popularity. It has become one of
        the most widely used programming languages, with <strong>C</strong> compilers available
        for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book
        <em>The <strong>C</strong> Programming Language</em>, co-authored by the original
        language designer, served for many years as the <em>de facto</em> standard for the
        language. <strong>C</strong> has been standardized since 1989 by the
        <em>American National Standards Institute (ANSI)</em> and, subsequently, jointly by the
        <em>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</em> and the
        <em>International Electrotechnical commission (IEC)</em>.

        Created by <span class="developer">Guido van Rossum</span>, <strong>Python</strong> is an
        interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. <strong>Python</strong>'s
        design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
        whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers
        write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.<br />
        <strong>Python</strong> is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
        programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
        <strong>Python</strong> is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
        comprehensive standard library.<br /><strong>Python</strong> was conceived in the late
        1980s as a successor to the <em>ABC</em> language. <strong>Python 2.0</strong>, released
        in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system
        capable of collecting reference cycles. <strong>Python 3.0</strong>, released in 2008,
        was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much
        <strong>Python 2</strong> code does not run unmodified on <strong>Python 3</strong>.

        Originally developed by <span class="developer">James Gosling</span> at
        <em>Sun Microsystems</em> (which has since been acquired by <em>Oracle</em>),
        <strong>Java</strong> is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based,
        object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It
        is intended to let application developers <em>write once, run anywhere (WORA)</em>,
        meaning that compiled <strong>Java</strong> code can run on all platforms that support
        <strong>Java</strong> without the need for recompilation.
        <strong>Java</strong> applications are typically compiled to <em>bytecode</em> that can
        run on any <em>Java virtual machine (JVM)</em> regardless of the underlying computer
        architecture. The syntax of <strong>Java</strong> is similar to
        <em><a href="#c" class="underline hover:text-slate-400">C</a></em> and <em>C++</em>, but
        it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The <strong>Java</strong> runtime
        provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are
        typically not available in traditional compiled languages. <strong>Java</strong> was the
        third most popular programming language in 2022 according to <em>GitHub</em>.<br />As of
        March 2024, <em><strong>Java</strong> 22</em> is the latest version (previous LTS
        versions 8, 11, 17, and 21 are still officially supported).

      <p>
        Designed by <span class="developer">Brendan Eich</span> of <em>Netscape</em>,
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> (often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>) is a programming
        language and core technology of the Web, alongside <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>. 99% of
        websites use it on the <em>client side</em> for webpage behavior.<br />Web browsers have
        a dedicated <em><strong>JavaScript</strong> engine</em> that executes the client code.
        These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular
        <em>runtime system</em> for non-browser usage is <em>Node.js</em>.
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often <em>just-in-time</em> compiled
        language that conforms to the <em>ECMAScript</em> standard. It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
        <em>application programming interfaces (APIs)</em> for working with text, dates, regular
        expressions, standard data structures, and the
        <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em>.<br />The ECMAScript standard does not include any
        input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the
        web browser or other runtime system provides <strong>JavaScript</strong> APIs for I/O.<br />Although
        <em><a href="#java" class="underline hover:text-slate-400">Java</a></em> and
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard
        libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
