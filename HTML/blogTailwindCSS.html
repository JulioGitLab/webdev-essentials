            Originally created at <em>Bell Labs</em> by <span class="developer">Dennis Ritchie</span>, <strong>C</strong>
            (/<em>si:</em>/, as in the letter <em>c</em>) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language
            supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents
            unintended operations. By design, <strong>C</strong> provides constructs that map efficiently to typical
            machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such
            applications include operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers to
            embedded systems.<br />A successor to the programming language <em>B</em>, <strong>C</strong> was originally
            developed to construct utilities runing on <em>Unix</em>. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the
            Unix operating system. During the 1980s, <strong>C</strong> gradually gained popularity. It has become one of
            the most widely used programming languages, with <strong>C</strong> compilers available for practically all
            modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book <em>The <strong>C</strong> Programming
            Language</em>, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the <em>de facto</em>
            standard for the language. <strong>C</strong> has been standarized since 1989 by the <em>American National
            Standards Institute (ANSI)</em> and, subsequently, jointly by the <em>International Organization for
            Standardization (ISO)</em> and the <em>International Electrotechnical Commision (IEC)</em>.

            Created by <span class="developer">Guido van Rossum</span>, <strong>Python</strong> is an interpreted, high-level,
            general-purpose programming language. <strong>Python</strong>'s design philosophy emphasizes code readability with
            its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help
            programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.<br /><strong>Python</strong> is
            dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
            object-oriented, and functional programming. <strong>Python</strong> is often described as a "batteries included"
            language due to its comprehensive standard library.<br /><strong>Python</strong> was conceived in the late 1980s
            as a successor to the <em>ABC</em> language. <strong>Python 2.0</strong>, released in 2000, introduced features
            like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. <strong>Python
            3.0</strong>, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible,
            and much <strong>Python 2</strong> code does not run unmodified on <strong>Python 3</strong>.

         <h6 class="text-xs m-1">Released in 1995.</h6>

         <p>
            Originally developed by <span class="developer">James Gosling</span> at <em>Sun Microsystems</em> (which has
            since been acquired by <em>Oracle</em>), <strong>Java</strong> is a general-purpose programming language
            that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
            It is intended to let application developers <em>write once, run anywhere (WORA)</em>, meaning that compiled
            <strong>Java</strong> code can run on all platforms that support <strong>Java</strong> without the need for
            recompilation. <strong>Java</strong> applications are typically compiled to <em>bytecode</em> that can run
            on any <em>Java virtual machine (JVM)</em> regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of
            <strong>Java</strong> is similar to <em><a href="#c" class="underline hover:text-slate-400">C</a></em> and
            <em>C++</em>, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The <strong>Java</strong> runtime
            provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) thet are typically not
            available in traditional compiled languages. <strong>Java</strong> was the third most popular programming
            language in 2022 according to <em>GitHub</em>.<br />As of March 2024, <em><strong>Java</strong> 22</em> is
            the latest version (previous LTS versions 8, 11, 17, and 21 are still officially supported).

         <h2 class="text-3xl m-3">JavaScript</h2>

         <h6 class="text-xs m-1">Released in 1995.</h6>

         <p>
            Designed by <span class="developer">Brendan Eich</span> of <em>Netscape</em>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>
            (often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>) is a programming language and core technology of the Web,
            alongside <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>. 99% of websites use it on the <em>client side</em> for webpage
            behavior.<br />Web browsers have a dedicated <em><strong>JavaScript</strong> engine</em> that executes
            the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular
            <em>runtime system</em> for non-browser usage is <em>Node.js</em>. <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a
            high-level, often <em>just-in-time</em> compiled language that conforms to the <em>ECMAScript</em>
            standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
            <em>application programming interfaces (APIs)</em> for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
            standard data structures, and the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em>.<br />The ECMAScript standard does
            not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the
            web browser or other runtime system provides <strong>JavaScript</strong> APIs for I/O.<br />Although
            <em><a href="#java" class="underline hover:text-slate-400">Java</a></em> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>
            are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ
            greatly in design.
