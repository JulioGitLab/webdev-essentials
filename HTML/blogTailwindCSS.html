        Originally created at <em>Bell Labs</em> by <span class="developer">Dennis Ritchie</span>,
        <strong>C</strong> (/<em>si:</em>/, as in the letter <em>c</em>) is a general-purpose,
        procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical
        variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.
        By design, <strong>C</strong> provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine
        instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly
        language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for
        computers, from supercomputers to embedded systems.<br />A successor to the programming
        language <em>B</em>, <strong>C</strong> was originally developed to construct utilities
        running on <em>Unix</em>. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix
        operating system. During the 1980s, <strong>C</strong> gradually gained popularity. It has
        become one of the most widely used programming languages, with <strong>C</strong>
        compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating
        systems. The book <em>The <strong>C</strong> Programming Language</em>, co-authored by the
        original language designer, served for many years as the <em>de facto</em> standard for
        the language. <strong>C</strong> has been standardized since 1989 by the <em>American
        National Standards Institute (ANSI)</em> and, subsequently, jointly by the
        <em>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</em> and the <em>International
        Electrotechnical commission (IEC)</em>.

        Created by <span class="developer">Guido van Rossum</span>, <strong>Python</strong> is an
        interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. <strong>Python</strong>'s
        design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
        whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers
        write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.<br /><strong>Python</strong>
        is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
        including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. <strong>Python</strong>
        is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
        library.<br /><strong>Python</strong> was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to
        the <em>ABC</em> language. <strong>Python 2.0</strong>, released in 2000, introduced
        features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting
        reference cycles. <strong>Python 3.0</strong>, released in 2008, was a major revision of
        the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much <strong>Python
        2</strong> code does not run unmodified on <strong>Python 3</strong>.

      <h6 class="text-xs m-1">Released in 1995.</h6>

      <p>
        Originally developed by <span class="developer">James Gosling</span> at <em>Sun
        Microsystems</em> (which has since been acquired by <em>Oracle</em>),
        <strong>Java</strong> is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based,
        object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It
        is intended to let application developers <em>write once, run anywhere (WORA)</em>,
        meaning that compiled <strong>Java</strong> code can run on all platforms that support
        <strong>Java</strong> without the need for recompilation. <strong>Java</strong>
        applications are typically compiled to <em>bytecode</em> that can run on any <em>Java
        virtual machine (JVM)</em> regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax
        of <strong>Java</strong> is similar to
        <em><a href="#c" class="underline hover:text-slate-400">C</a></em> and <em>C++</em>, but
        it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The <strong>Java</strong> runtime
        provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are
        typically not available in traditional compiled languages. <strong>Java</strong> was the
        third most popular programming language in 2022 according to <em>GitHub</em>.<br />As of
        March 2024, <em><strong>Java</strong> 22</em> is the latest version (previous LTS versions
        8, 11, 17, and 21 are still officially supported).

      <p>
        Designed by <span class="developer">Brendan Eich</span> of <em>Netscape</em>,
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> (often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>) is a programming
        language and core technology of the Web, alongside <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em>. 99% of
        websites use it on the <em>client side</em> for webpage behavior.<br />Web browsers have
        a dedicated <em><strong>JavaScript</strong> engine</em> that executes the client code.
        These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular
        <em>runtime system</em> for non-browser usage is <em>Node.js</em>.
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often <em>just-in-time</em> compiled language
        that conforms to the <em>ECMAScript</em> standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
        object-orientation, and first class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
        event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has <em>application
        programming interfaces (APIs)</em> for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
        standard data structures, and the <em>Document Object Model (DOM)</em>.<br />The
        ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage,
        or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> APIs for I/O.<br />Although
        <em><a href="#java" class="underline hover:text-slate-400">Java</a></em> and
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard
        libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
